## Build provenance and compatibility

- Windows x64 **rebuilt** isolated MSVC candidate SHA256: `35B953C97F870CBD7426DC865783BE36090F841C273AE779BD098E9F080F3735`. This is not a claim of binary identity with earlier unavailable experimental builds.
- Windows x64 applies the tracked tokenizer compatibility patch and dual-liveness patch.
- Portable ARM64 candidate SHA256: `6BDE0FAF466261C8233298ECB2BDF01A78AAEBE9729C03BA4EA95F045F772737`.
- Windows ARM64 applies the tracked tokenizer patch, but not the dual-liveness patch. Build on native ARM64 with ClangCL, `GGML_NATIVE=OFF`, and `GGML_CPU_ARM_ARCH=armv8-a`; audit normal and delay-load PE imports for OS/UCRT/VC runtime dependencies.
- The upstream source must contain the verified chat-PEG parser security fix. Changes to patch scope, architecture or portability require review.
- The authoritative revision, model, patch and binary hashes are in `src/zenz_runtime/llama_runtime.lock.json`; this document is a checked consumer. After a validated update, synchronize with `python tools/zenz_runtime/runtime_lock.py sync --write --diff` and run `check`.

## Build/runtime policy

- CPU only
- `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`
- `GGML_OPENMP=OFF`
- `GGML_NATIVE=OFF`
- `GGML_BLAS=OFF`
- `GGML_CPU_KLEIDIAI=OFF`
- `LLAMA_BUILD_UI=OFF`
- `LLAMA_OPENSSL=OFF`
- scorer launches `llama-server` with `--parallel 1`
- server binds to `127.0.0.1`
- scorer supplies a generated API key
- the Windows installer installs enabled outbound/block firewall rules for `mozc_zenz_scorer.exe` and `llama-server.exe`, in addition to the existing Mozc runtime rules
- the firewall rules must not break scorer-to-llama loopback inference and must be removed during uninstall
- no `ggml.dll`, `ggml-base.dll`, `ggml-cpu.dll`, or `llama.dll` is packaged
- `MSVCP140.dll` / `VCRUNTIME140*.dll` remain dynamic dependencies and are supplied through the existing architecture-specific MSI CRT payload.

## MSI architecture contract

- x64 MSI: x64 Mozkey + x64 scorer + x64 llama-server + x64 CRT
- ARM64 MSI: ARM64 Mozkey + ARM64 scorer + ARM64 llama-server + ARM64 CRT
- the Zenz model is architecture-independent and has one fixed SHA256.
- universal MSI is not treated as a dual-native whole-product package in this phase.

## Installed security gate

Before promoting a Windows runtime, test the **installed MSI payload**, not only repository binaries:

- All seven Mozc outbound/block Windows Firewall rules must be installed, enabled, and point to the installed executables.
- The installed scorer-to-llama inference path must work with these rules enabled.
- `llama-server.exe` must listen on loopback only; scorer and llama must have no non-loopback TCP connections in the audit. Never expose generated API keys in evidence.
- Native architecture, file hashes, model loading, access control and installed scorer context must be verified for each supported MSI architecture.
- Final uninstall must remove Zenz payload and Mozc firewall rules.

## Installer lifecycle gate

Verify normal Windows Installer behavior **without first uninstalling the predecessor**:

- A published release must increase MSI `ProductVersion` over the preceding public release; use a new `ProductCode` and preserve the Mozc `UpgradeCode`.
- A normal `msiexec /i` upgrade must replace the installed runtime with the pinned binary, remove obsolete ggml/llama DLLs, preserve the functional scorer path, and leave no old product registration.
- Repeat-install of the exact current MSI must not duplicate firewall rules.
- Final uninstall must clean product registration, payload and firewall rules.
- Development CI artifacts may have the same `ProductVersion` when testing upgrade mechanics; do not treat that as meeting the public release versioning requirement.
- Forced `REINSTALL=ALL REINSTALLMODE=amus` is not part of the normal upgrade contract.
- Include a Windows x64 installed-IME / Zenz ON/OFF smoke test and ARM64 native installed-MSI and lifecycle tests where supported; preserve any untested limitations in evidence.

## Quality and release validation gate

- Compare a pinned old runtime and the proposed new runtime against the same Japanese-conversion test corpus, recording reference-exact results, output differences and latency.
- Review each changed output for meaning and correctness; do not infer universal accuracy from a fixed evaluation sample. Investigate unexpected regressions before promotion.
- Record the exact CI run, package SHA256, version/architecture, installed MSI upgrade results, and known limitations in a **version-specific report**, not in this contract.
- Keep the canonical runtime hashes in the lock and make them pass the read-only CI gate.

## Current install-directory compatibility note

The current WiX layout keeps `MozcDir` under `ProgramFilesFolder\Mozc` for
compatibility with the existing product layout. On 64-bit Windows this can
resolve to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozc`. Runtime architecture is therefore
verified from PE identity and hashes, not inferred from the directory name.

Changing this directory contract to `ProgramFiles64Folder` is outside this
runtime-architecture phase because it affects installer compatibility and must
be handled with its own upgrade/lifecycle audit.
